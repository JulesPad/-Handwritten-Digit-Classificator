# Handwritten Digit Classificator
Here is a CNN model developed for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification that can detect handwritten digits from 1 to 9.

For this, I've used the MNIST data set is one of the most famous datasets available. It is a composition of 70,000 pictures of handwritten digits. For this classification problem, I've used the resnet18 architecture (without weights, which means that the model doesn't have any part that is pretrained). 

The accuracy is of **99.8%**
